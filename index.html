        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 40 year old Native New Yorker.  I have been working with computers and languages on and off for 20 years but never mastered any, I hope to change that in this course. I love to spend my free time with family and friends.  On my down time I like to play and watch all kinds of sports.

        <h3>More About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I was first interested in programming when I first started college in 1996 when I started to learn html on my own.  I never mastered the language and life took me in another direction.  Somehow though, I have always been pulled back to work with computers.  I have done hardware and software installations for family and for my jobs (Cable technician).
           </p>

<p>
          I did not finish college because I was in the military for 8 years serving with the Unites States Marine Corps.  During that time I tried to settle down and begin to think about life and work for my family.  This took me away from my work with computers.  But eventually I would try to get my Bachelors degree and along that journey I did try to dive back into computers taking some computer science classes. </p>
<p>
          As life turns out to teach us many lessons in our life.  I would learn that I am on another path in my life and this is where General Assembly comes in.  I hope that this cousrse helps me finally master my skills and love for computers.

        </p>
        <p>
          I am a very socialble person that can lead to great teamwork building.  I have lead many different people throughout my career leading to efficent and successful projects.  With the skills I learn in class, my work ethic and my personality I hope to be a valuable asset to the company I land with.
